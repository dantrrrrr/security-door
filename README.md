## Introduction

The Security Door project aims to create a robust and reliable access control system for securing premises such as offices, labs, or any other restricted areas. The system utilizes various technologies to authenticate and authorize access, including RFID cards, biometric identification, and a web-based control panel for monitoring and managing access.

## Features

- RFID Card Authentication: Users can use RFID cards to gain access to the secured area.
- Biometric Identification: Optionally, the system can be equipped with biometric sensors for enhanced security.
- Web-based Control Panel: An intuitive web interface for administrators to manage users, access permissions, and view logs.
- Access Log: The system maintains a log of all access attempts for auditing purposes.
- Alerts: The system can generate real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts or security breaches.
- Configuration Options: Easily customizable to suit specific security requirements and hardware configurations.

## Requirements

Before setting up the Security Door system, ensure you have the following components:

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- RFID Reader and compatible RFID cards
- Biometric Sensors (optional)
- Electric Lock Mechanism
- Web Server (for hosting the control panel)
- Internet connectivity (for real-time alerts)

## Installation

To install the Security Door system on your microcontroller, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/dantrrrrr/security-door.git


2. Install any necessary dependencies or libraries required for your microcontroller.

3. Configure the system parameters and customize access control rules in the configuration files.

## Usage

After installation, connect the required hardware components to your microcontroller and ensure they are properly interfaced. Power on the system and follow these usage instructions:

1. Users can present their RFID cards to the RFID reader for authentication.
2. Optionally, biometric sensors can be used for further authentication.
3. The web-based control panel allows administrators to add or remove users, grant or revoke access permissions, and monitor access logs.

## Configuration

The configuration files are essential for setting up the Security Door system. Review the configuration options available and make changes according to your requirements. Ensure to configure the RFID card data and user access rules appropriately.
